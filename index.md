## About Me

I am working as a Remote Research Intern at [Vision-CAIR, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://vision-cair.kaust.edu.sa/), supervised by [Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/people/person/mohamed-elhoseiny). Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Management from Lanzhou University, China.

## Research Interests

- **Generative Models:** Image Generation, Video Generation, Sequence Generation
- **Vision-Language:** Multi-modal Comprehension and Generation
- **Efficient:** Multi-modal token compression for efficient modeling

My long-term goal is to build general-purpose multimodal systems that can perceive, reason, and
communicate effectively across visual, textual, and behavioral modalities in dynamic, real-world environments.
